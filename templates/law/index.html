<h3>Welcome to the Collateral Consequences of Criminal Charges Calculator.</h3>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This calculator is designed as an aid to legal research for judges, attorneys and legal academics. It can provide a preliminary overview of the collateral consequences associated with sections of the New York State Penal Law. You may use this as a way of seeing the big picture and beginning the process of parsing the varied consequences of criminal charges. As the calculator cannot account for the specific circumstances of each defendant, it is up to you to research and analyze the ultimate consequences of each charge in the context of the defendant&#8217;s life.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>In this, the initial version of the Calculator, we have tracked the collateral consequences in two important substantive areas:  <b>immigration</b> and <b>public housing in New York City</b>. The <b>immigration</b> consequences are analyzed for the top 50 crimes that are either most commonly charged or most misunderstood. The <b>public housing</b> consequences are analyzed for all crimes listed in the Penal Law, but apply only to public housing in New York City.</p>

<h3>Use</h3>

<p>Charges are ordered by penal code number in a menu on the left hand
side of the screen that mimics the organization of the New York Penal
Law. Click on a number range grouping to open that area of the menu
and select a charge. Once you've selected a charge, the consequences
of that charge will appear in a three column break-down on the right
that reflects the probability that a consequence will attach to a
conviction. To compare the consequences that flow from two different
charges select and display the consequences for the first charge and
then select and display the consequences for the second charge. For
more information please view this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcq0p72_274" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.</p>
