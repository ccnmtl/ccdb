<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This calculator is designed as an aid to legal research for judges, attorneys and legal academics. It can provide a preliminary overview of the collateral consequences associated with sections of the New York State Penal Law. You may use this as a way of seeing the big picture and beginning the process of parsing the varied consequences of criminal charges. As the Calculator cannot account for the specific circumstances of each defendant, it is up to you to research and analyze the ultimate consequences of each charge in the context of the defendant's life. For example, in the area of immigration consequences, accurate analysis and attorney advice to a noncitizen defendant will depend on investigation of individual circumstances, such as the defendant's immigration status, prior criminal record, the specific contents of the court record of conviction and whether the particular defendant might be ineligible for relief from removal depending on circumstances such as family ties or length of residence in the United States.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>In this, the initial version of the Calculator, we have tracked the collateral consequences in two important substantive areas: immigration and public housing eligibility in New York City. The immigration consequences are analyzed for the <a href="topcrimes">top 200 crimes</a> that are either most commonly charged or carry consequences that are commonly misunderstood. The public housing eligibility consequences are analyzed for all crimes listed in the Penal Law, but apply only to public housing in New York City.</p>

<h3>Use</h3>

<p>Charges are ordered by penal law number in a menu on the left hand side of the screen that mimics the organization of the New York Penal Law. Click on a number range grouping to open that area of the menu and select a charge. Once you've selected a charge, the consequences of that charge will appear in a three column break-down on the right that reflects the probability that a consequence will attach to a conviction. To compare the consequences that flow from two different charges select and display the consequences for the first charge and then select and display the consequences for the second charge. For more information please view this <a href="tutorial">tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>This calculator is not designed to provide legal advice over the Internet. Legal advice is dependent upon the specific circumstances of each situation. The information provided here is targeted toward collateral consequences in New York. The law varies from state to state, so that some information provided herein may not be correct outside New York State. In addition, immigration consequences which involve federal law may vary from one federal jurisdiction to another. While every effort is made to keep the content on this site current, the information contained herein is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. Therefore, the information provided herein cannot replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in your state.</p>

<p>Also, in the interest of making sure that defendants are aware of all possible risks, the Calculator may warn of probable or possible potential negative consequences even where there may be good arguments that conviction of a particular offense should not trigger these consequences. A skilled advocate may be able to overcome some of the potential consequences. Therefore, the information provided through the Calculator should not be taken as an absolute limitation on what such advocacy might achieve.</p>
